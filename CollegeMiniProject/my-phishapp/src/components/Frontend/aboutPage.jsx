                        <p className="lead">
                            <strong>PhishAware</strong> is an academic project developed by MCA students at the Institute of Management and Career Courses (IMCC), Pune. Our mission is to empower organizations and individuals to defend against the ever-evolving threat of phishing and social engineering attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The platform provides a safe environment for simulating phishing attacks, enabling employees to recognize, report, and learn from real-world scenarios. By bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical defense, PhishAware helps organizations foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness.
